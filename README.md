# Home_Advisor_Exercise

Features:
- Initiates a network request to asynchronously fetch json data, model data, and populate results in a table view. 

Challenges:
- Implemented an algorithm to sort data in a hash table -- keyed by a specified variable in the model -- in order to present the data in a grouped table view.

Insights:
- After revisiting and analyzing the project, it could be improved by eliminating the use of "magic strings" and force unwrapped objects, as well as reducing the use of global methods.
